# Decentralized-Portfolio

#### Invest according to market sentiments with the power of decentralization

## Description
There are lots of portfolios out there. These all portfolios are controlled by a centralized person/authority. So in the traditional portfolios, the sentiments of centralized authority may not be the same as sentiments of the market. This could lead the entire portfolio in the wrong direction. We built a platform, where no centralized authority will make decisions regarding the portfolio. All the decisions regarding the portfolio will be made by all the investors by voting. All the investors will have a say in the portfolio decision. So more investors mean more accurate prediction of market sentiments. Anyone can be a part of the portfolio. The user can join/leave the portfolio anytime they want. The funds which are locked in the smart contract follows the strategy which is decided by all the investors through voting.
